# Cafe Finder

This is an app that allows a user to search for cafes and coffee shops. The app will use an api to provide search results. Users will be able to sign-up for a user profile, where they can save and keep notes about their favorite cafes.

## Tech Stack:

- React, Javascript, MongoDB, Mongoose, HTML, CSS, Express, bcrypt, JSON Web Tokens, Axios, Yelp API

## User Stories

- As a user I want to be able to search for coffee shops near me.
- As a user I want to log into a user profile and save things like my favorite coffee shops and my favorite drinks.
- As a user I want to be able to see the details of specific cafes (free wifi, brand of coffee, rating, price, etc.).
- As a user I want to be able to share my recommendations to other users.


## API and Proof of Concept
We plan on using the Yelp API to find coffee shops through the API.
